- 👋 Hi, I’m @woodrufa
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about data science, ML and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data science through the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate yet...first I have to figure out how to use all these things and go from totally incompetent to mildly competent.
- 📫 How to reach me ... well, for now I'm hoping you can't reach me because I'm just trying to understand GitHub, Jupyter, Python, R etc.
